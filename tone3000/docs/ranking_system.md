# Allomorph Storefront Voicing Ranking Architecture

This document defines the ranking and ordering system governing the digital twin voicings in **Allomorph Tone Packs** on [Tone3000](https://tone3000.com).

---

## 1. Core Principles

The Allomorph ranking architecture is built on four fundamental tenets designed to maximize user engagement, storefront clarity, and musical value:

### 1.1 Inverse-Availability Principle (Native Identity Exclusion)
When a player browses or loads a tone pack for their physical bass, the primary value proposition is **transformational capacity**—giving the player sounds they **cannot** physically achieve with their stock instrument.
- **Rule:** 1:1 base-instrument identity duplicates ($H_{\text{diff}} \equiv 1.0$) where the target pickup geometry and circuit match the player's stock instrument (producing a straight-wire bypass with zero difference between dry and wet) are **excluded** from the pack. Players do not need a neural network to emulate the exact physical pickup and circuit already installed in their guitar.
- **Example (Precision Bass):** Excludes `Vintage 62 P` (since the player's bass already possesses this exact Alnico V split-coil CTS 250k circuit). Retains modified ToneStyler capacitive shunts (22nF, 47nF flatwound, 100nF Fullerton) and modern ceramic 500k configurations which deliver distinct electrical curves.
- **Example (Jazz Bass):** Excludes `60s Jazz Pair` and `60s Jazz Bridge` (matches stock dual single-coils and bridge single-coil).
- **Example (P/J Bass):** Excludes `Vintage PJ Passive`, `Vintage 62 P`, and `60s Jazz Bridge` (matches the player's native 3-way switch positions).
- **Example (Active StingRay):** Excludes `StingRay Parallel` (matches the stock active bridge humbucker in parallel).

### 1.2 Popularity & Transformative Demand Weighting
Among the non-native/transformative voicings, tones are ranked according to **real-world musical demand and recording ubiquity**:
- **Tier 1 (Universal Workhorses):** Jazz Bass dual-single scooped slap and active Sadowsky NYC 2-band; Music Man StingRay active parallel bite and series punch.
- **Tier 2 (Modern Boutique & Rock Legends):** Lakland/Sandberg P/MM active hybrids, Rickenbacker 4003 prog-rock clank with HPF, Dingwall multi-scale modern metal clank.
- **Tier 3 (Specialty & Historical Archetypes):** Gibson EB-0 Mudbucker ultra-low series humbucker.
- **Tier 4 (Acoustic Transducers):** Upright Acoustic Double Bass bridge force sensor simulation.

### 1.3 Strict Modular Topology Separation
Storefront categories must accurately reflect analog electrical topologies and physical coil arrangements. Arbitrary "catch-all" groupings are strictly forbidden:
- **Music Man StingRay Family:** Pure 2-band active dual-coil humbuckers placed at the bridge sweet spot are strictly isolated from hybrid models.
- **P/MM Modern Hybrids:** Compound dual-pickup configurations (Split-P neck + Music Man bridge) form their own dedicated hybrid category.
- **Progressive & Classic Rock Legends:** Historic and modern rock clank archetypes (Rickenbacker 4003, Dingwall, Gibson Mudbucker) are unified under a dedicated rock category.
- **Acoustic Transducers:** Piezo force sensor simulations are cleanly isolated from magnetic pickup guitars.

### 1.4 Terminal Studio Character & Buffer Anchor
The final positions in every pack are reserved for studio impedance and loading transformations:
- **Active Character (Modern Studio Active Buffer):** Deconvolves $750\text{ pF}$ cable capacitance and pot damping from the user's physical pickups, shifting resonance into the hi-fi air band ($7.5\text{--}9.0\text{ kHz}$) with $1\text{M}\Omega$ input impedance.
- **Passive Character (High-Impedance Passive Pickup & Cable Loading):** Simulates an authentic high-impedance passive RLC network ($L = 4.2\text{ H}, f_r = 2.8\text{ kHz}, Q = 1.4$) loaded by a standard $250\text{k}\Omega$ CTS volume/tone harness and $750\text{ pF}$ cable capacitance. On active instruments (StingRay, Active Soapbar), it replaces sterile onboard active buffering with organic vintage passive dynamics, woody low-mid body, and rolled-off highs.
- **Ordering Rule (Inverse-Availability):** For passive instrument editions (`standard_precision_bass`, `standard_jazz_bass`, `standard_pj_bass`, `mustang_pj_bass`), Active Character is ranked before Passive Character because passive players seeking an active buffer prioritize the active transformation. Conversely, for active instrument editions (`active_emg_bass`, `active_stingray_bass`, `preamp_soapbar_bass`), Passive Character is ranked before Active Character, as transforming an active instrument into an organic high-impedance passive RLC network provides the primary transformative value of the product ("Passivizer").

## 3. Governance & Quality Checklist

When modifying or generating new Tone3000 pack listings:
1. **Verify Native Identity Exclusion:** Confirm that $1:1$ identical base-instrument configurations ($H_{\text{diff}} \equiv 1.0$) are omitted.
2. **Preserve Distinct Families:** Confirm StingRay is never merged with P/J, and P/MM is never merged with Acoustic Transducers.
3. **Check Character Limits:** Ensure the total listing length strictly remains under 10,000 characters.
4. **Preserve Bracketed Tags:** Every multi-pickup listing must contain `[Parallel]`, `[Neck]`, or `[Bridge]` tags.
5. **Active Calibration Integrity:** Active editions must direct players to set onboard active EQs flat at center detents.
